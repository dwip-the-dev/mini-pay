## Important Notes 🔥

* `users.json` is **auto-populated**. You don’t need to create it manually — if it doesn’t exist, the app will make an empty one automatically.
* All data (balances & transactions) are stored **locally in `users.json`**.
* This is a **demo** — passwords are stored in plain text. Do **not use real passwords** 💀
